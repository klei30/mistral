"""
This is a Python script that creates a vector database using the langchain library. The script imports several modules from the langchain library, including HuggingFaceEmbeddings, FAISS, PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader, and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

The script defines a function called create_vector_db() that creates a vector database. The function does the following:

It creates an instance of the DirectoryLoader class, which loads all PDF files from the specified data path using the PyPDFLoader class.
It loads the documents and splits them into smaller chunks using an instance of the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class.
It creates an instance of the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class, which is used to generate embeddings for the text chunks.
It creates an instance of the FAISS class, which is used to create a vector database from the text chunks and their embeddings.
It saves the vector database to a local file specified by the DB_FAISS_PATH variable.
